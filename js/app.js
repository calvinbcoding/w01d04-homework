//1.) Verbal Questions:
//		1.) In a JS function, a parameter is a varable used to define 
//			the function while an argument is a piece of data that is 
//			passed into the function. 
//		2.) conse.log(); is like a function within that function; it's 
//			purpose is to log a value in the console (it also serves the
// 			purpose of debugging the function). Return is the result of a
// 			function when it is finished; console.log doesn't stop the function
//			from continueing to run--return does. 
// 		3.) If you can write a function to return a value then you are asking
// 			the computer to actually compute something. Without functions 
//			(code that serves to give a defined output for a given input value)
//			the computer wouldn't be computing anything. It would basically
//			just be a database storing values written out by coders.
